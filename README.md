# Rough_Work
## My Coding Playground

This GitHub repository is my personal code sandbox. Here, I experiment with new concepts, test my skills with coding challenges, and build miniature projects to solidify my understanding. Think of it as a programmer's sketchbook!  Feel free to peek in, see what I'm working on, and maybe even inspire your own coding adventures!
